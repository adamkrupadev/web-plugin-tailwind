# Tailwind CSS Website Clones
## These are website clones made using [Tailwind CSS](tailwindcss.com). The goal is to use as much of the default CSS as possible.
Icons are sourced from [Zondicons](zondicons.com) and I try to match the subject as much as possible. Any custom CSS needed is included in each file. The tailwind CDN is being used as the source of the CSS so you dont need to compile anything.
The list so far: 
* Tesla
* Youtube
* Bellroy
* Whatsapp
